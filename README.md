## **Backend Development**

Backend development focuses on developing the business logic/structure of the software that runs on the server-side. It is time consuming and requires implementing complex business logics. This is an opportunity for developers to have many Job opportunities but at the same time it is not easy, with compared to front end development, to learn it within a short period of time. 

In order for one to be a backend developer, one has to learn backend development programming languages such as Java, C#, Python, Ruby,Nodejs....Each of them has a different framework built on top of each programming language mentioned here that helps to develop different kinds of applications. For example, if you are hired as a Java backend developer you might need to know Java, Spring, Hibernate or Java, J2EE. 

But in order to have firm understanding on these technologies it is better to follow the following step. 

   **Java -> Servlet -> JSP/Struts -> Hibernate-> Spring/J2EEIf**       

If you are interested to learn these technologies these are the resource you might have to look in to
